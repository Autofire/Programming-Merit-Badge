<h1 algin='center'> Programming Merit Badge </h1>
This repository (repo) contains everything a Counselor needs to teach a Merit Badge class except your own flare and expertise.  

## Who am I?
My name is Bob Baker, Troop 787, Orange County Council, CA.
I am a current (as of 2018) Computer Science student at Saddleback College.  I joined Scouts in 2007 and earned my Eagle in 2014. Since 2010, I have been working with the Council's NYLT program while trying to help build permanent programs across the Council including this Programming Merit Badge material.  I hope this material helps lower the barrier to teaching the Programming Merit Badge so more Scouts can be introduced to the world of programming.

## Who is this for?
This repo is intended for Programming Merit Badge Counselors and Scouts trying to earn their Badge. Contained in this repo are example programs, "Hello Worlds" and a PowerPoint outlining the requirements and key concepts of the Programming Merit Badge.
